This is a Java console program that implements a simple calculator with a menu-driven interface. The program allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers. The user is presented with a menu of options to choose from, and the program prompts the user to enter the numbers to perform the selected operation.
